1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:02,005
- This course is designed to introduce you

2
00:00:02,005 --> 00:00:03,007
to the basic concepts

3
00:00:03,007 --> 00:00:06,008
of infrastructure as code DevOps style,

4
00:00:06,008 --> 00:00:09,003
that means hot and sassy.

5
00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:10,007
To get the most out of this course,

6
00:00:10,007 --> 00:00:13,004
you may want to watch the course DevOps Fundamentals here

7
00:00:13,004 --> 00:00:15,004
in the library for context.

8
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:17,001
In that course, James and I discussed

9
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:18,006
the foundations of DevOps

10
00:00:18,006 --> 00:00:21,000
and how the three major practice areas,

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
infrastructure as code, continuous delivery,

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,008
and site reliability engineering fit into it.

13
00:00:27,008 --> 00:00:29,009
This course drills down into infrastructure

14
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:33,002
as code specifically to discuss it in depth.

15
00:00:33,002 --> 00:00:34,005
To get the most from this course,

16
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:37,003
you should be familiar with system admin basics,

17
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:40,000
be able to use the command line and SSH,

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and be familiar with some sort of programming or scripting.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,003
We'll be using the Linux Command Line on the AWS Cloud

20
00:00:47,003 --> 00:00:49,007
and an Akaunting GitHub for our demos.

21
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,000
You should be able to reproduce it

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,005
from your desktop client of choice.

23
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:55,008
Our intent is for this course to be accessible

24
00:00:55,008 --> 00:00:59,007
for anyone with even a basic IT experience.

25
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:02,002
While we're making our source files available to you,

26
00:01:02,002 --> 00:01:05,001
this isn't meant to be a lab course where you follow along

27
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:08,007
and perform the activities to learn a specific technology.

28
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:09,009
Instead, we'll be talking

29
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:12,001
about infrastructure as code concepts,

30
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:14,005
why you would use them, and then illustrating

31
00:01:14,005 --> 00:01:17,004
how to implement them in a variety of tools.

32
00:01:17,004 --> 00:01:19,007
So don't expect detailed instructions

33
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:22,003
on how to install and configure those tools here,

34
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:25,001
but there are entire courses here in the library

35
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,000
on each one of them when you're ready.
