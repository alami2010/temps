1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:02,004
- The cloud is great because you can get

2
00:00:02,004 --> 00:00:04,001
the infrastructure you need

3
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:06,009
pretty much immediately when you need it.

4
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:09,009
- Okay, you're starting to sound like a commercial.

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,008
Do you work for Amazon now?

6
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:15,003
- [Announcer] Bare metal versus cloud, fight.

7
00:00:15,003 --> 00:00:17,003
- You can't beat the cloud's agility.

8
00:00:17,003 --> 00:00:19,001
Instead of waiting to buy hardware,

9
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:20,006
get it put into a data center,

10
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:23,004
and whatever annoying process your IT department ladles

11
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:24,005
on top of that,

12
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:26,009
you can get the servers you need with a click of a button,

13
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:30,000
bit of typing at a command line or a brief lick

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,001
of an API or whatever it is you do to an API.

15
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:36,002
- Okay, first of all, that's oddly disturbing.

16
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:38,004
Second of all, those servers aren't cheap Ernest

17
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:41,008
you can buy a good Dell server for what, about $5,000

18
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:43,007
but a cloud server of the same spec can cost you

19
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:45,008
like a $1.50 an hour.

20
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:47,001
Okay, when you put all that together

21
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:51,004
by my calculations, that's $13,000 in a year.

22
00:00:51,004 --> 00:00:54,008
- For sure, one to one, the cloud can be more expensive,

23
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:57,000
but first of all if you're really running that server

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,003
all the time, you can get a savings plan

25
00:00:59,003 --> 00:01:01,007
that'll cut 30% off the top.

26
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:04,009
You're also saving on administration and facility costs.

27
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:07,003
You're not just not buying that server

28
00:01:07,003 --> 00:01:08,008
you're paying for the data center,

29
00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:11,001
power, cooling, networking,

30
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:14,001
and system admins needed to make it work.

31
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:15,006
But maybe most importantly

32
00:01:15,006 --> 00:01:18,009
cloud savings isn't about running servers one to one.

33
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:23,005
It's about right sizing your servers and fleet dynamically.

34
00:01:23,005 --> 00:01:25,009
Think of a data center as a shipping container

35
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:28,004
full of liter containers of water.

36
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,003
The water's the work you're getting done

37
00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:32,004
but many of the containers aren't full

38
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:34,002
and you're paying for the containers you have

39
00:01:34,002 --> 00:01:36,006
and no matter how much water's in them.

40
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:38,009
In the cloud, it's like you can resize

41
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,004
the shipping container and the liter containers

42
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:42,009
to match the workload

43
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:45,006
and then you can save on all the excess.

44
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:47,000
- Are you done?

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,004
I mean, that's nice to put in the old cloud, to rain,

46
00:01:50,004 --> 00:01:53,002
to drinking water analogy, but come on

47
00:01:53,002 --> 00:01:56,002
since it's easy to just click and get more servers

48
00:01:56,002 --> 00:01:58,009
aren't my employees just going to run rampant and you know

49
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:00,006
get a bunch of servers like there's no tomorrow

50
00:02:00,006 --> 00:02:02,005
without a certified system administrator

51
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:05,000
or someone you know, watching and enforcing, you know

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
through compliance and audit?

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,009
- Well, sure, that can happen.

54
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:11,002
With great power comes great responsibility

55
00:02:11,002 --> 00:02:13,000
as my Uncle Ben once said.

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,006
But it's easy to put governance

57
00:02:14,006 --> 00:02:17,003
and quotas in place, and instead of having one big

58
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:20,001
organization be the giant cost center,

59
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:21,006
you can delegate out budget

60
00:02:21,006 --> 00:02:23,009
to the orgs using it, which improves behavior

61
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,005
around cost and benefit organizationally.

62
00:02:26,005 --> 00:02:29,004
- Okay, but isn't the cloud really complicated?

63
00:02:29,004 --> 00:02:31,007
I mean, you hear comedians all the time saying things like

64
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:33,001
no one understands the cloud,

65
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:36,004
and it's all this newfangled and scary thing.

66
00:02:36,004 --> 00:02:39,003
- Remember, we're comparing this to on-premise system

67
00:02:39,003 --> 00:02:41,000
and network administration.

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Pretty sure those standup comedians would be even

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,008
more puzzled by InfiniBand networking.

70
00:02:44,008 --> 00:02:47,001
- Okay, okay, that's fair.

71
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:49,005
- While it is new, and those of us like me

72
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:52,001
who came from a traditional system admin background

73
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:55,004
needed to learn some new things in order to use the cloud

74
00:02:55,004 --> 00:02:58,005
it's not any more complicated than an on-prem data center.

75
00:02:58,005 --> 00:03:00,007
And frankly, since it's more standard

76
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:03,009
you don't get the weird old special snowflakes boxes

77
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:06,009
in the corner with a do not touch sign on them.

78
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:10,004
- Okay, but what if we need specialized hardware?

79
00:03:10,004 --> 00:03:12,000
You can't get that in the cloud.

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,001
- Well, you'd be surprised, they have GPUs

81
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:18,006
FPGAs, quantum computing, 5G edge compute

82
00:03:18,006 --> 00:03:21,002
and a lot of very diverse hardware in the cloud.

83
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:24,007
But yeah, if you have a lot of super custom hardware needs

84
00:03:24,007 --> 00:03:26,005
you'll still need to roll your own.

85
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:28,005
Or if the cost instability

86
00:03:28,005 --> 00:03:31,001
of your use case really means it's financially

87
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:33,006
appropriate to build out your own hardware,

88
00:03:33,006 --> 00:03:35,008
but even then you probably want to use cloud for

89
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:39,002
all your other use cases that don't fit that description.

90
00:03:39,002 --> 00:03:42,007
And in my experience, less than 10% do.

91
00:03:42,007 --> 00:03:45,001
- Okay, Ernest, I'm convinced.

92
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:49,007
Like the kids say today, I'm down to cloud.

93
00:03:49,007 --> 00:03:51,004
- Never say that again.

94
00:03:51,004 --> 00:03:52,002
- No?

95
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:55,009
How about make it rain servers?

96
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:58,008
- That's another entry on the do not say list.

97
00:03:58,008 --> 00:04:01,005
- Okay, well, that was our completely objective debate

98
00:04:01,005 --> 00:04:04,002
on using real hardware versus using the cloud.

99
00:04:04,002 --> 00:04:07,000
We hope you enjoyed it and learned from it.
