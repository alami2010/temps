00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:03,004
- The cloud means different things to different people

2
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:07,003
but most expect network, compute, and storage.

3
00:00:07,003 --> 00:00:10,001
Now at the dawn of cloud, that was enough

4
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:13,000
but today the cloud is way more.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,008
Let's take a look at Azure's cloud offerings.

6
00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:18,005
As you can see, the choices are numerous.

7
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:20,003
Besides the basic services

8
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:23,002
there's a long list of managed services.

9
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:25,007
You can get managed databases of any flavor

10
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:29,009
from managed MySQL databases, to map reduce, to DNS,

11
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:33,004
and CDNs, but it doesn't stop there.

12
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:35,005
The options also include observability

13
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:37,004
and security offerings.

14
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:39,005
And this isn't limited to Microsoft.

15
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:44,003
Every major cloud provider, AWS, GCP, OCI,

16
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:46,005
they all have a huge set of managed services

17
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:49,001
that go beyond simple infrastructure.

18
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:51,006
The goal here is to provide specific functionality

19
00:00:51,006 --> 00:00:54,001
in a service that doesn't require the user to

20
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:57,003
configure the lower level servers and other components

21
00:00:57,003 --> 00:01:00,003
in order to get their desire workload performed.

22
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:02,009
Here's a list of past services that Microsoft Azure

23
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:05,001
recommends you use instead of building

24
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:06,009
and configuring them manually,

25
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:09,005
as you would in an on-premise data center.

26
00:01:09,005 --> 00:01:12,005
And they can be used to form sophisticated systems

27
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,008
all by themselves.

28
00:01:13,008 --> 00:01:16,001
So here's a Microsoft example architecture

29
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:18,007
for a social media analytics solution.

30
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:21,008
It's completely composed of managed services.

31
00:01:21,008 --> 00:01:25,005
Azure Synapse Analytics is used to ingest the data

32
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:28,004
and place it into Apache Spark pools.

33
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,001
It enriches that data using

34
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:34,000
Azure Cognitive Services Translator to translate text

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,007
and Azure Maps to link data to geographical coordinates.

36
00:01:38,007 --> 00:01:41,005
It stores the data in a serverless SQL pool

37
00:01:41,005 --> 00:01:45,002
inside Azure Synapse Analytics, and then makes it available

38
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:48,007
to users via Power BI dashboards.

39
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:52,005
While this solution certainly uses servers and databases

40
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:56,000
under the hood, you aren't interacting with them directly.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,001
You're only interacting with the managed services

42
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:00,008
at a more functional level.

43
00:02:00,008 --> 00:02:03,001
Store the data, translate this string,

44
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:07,002
geolocate this address, visualize the data,

45
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:09,009
that's what managed services are.

46
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:12,007
Next, we'll examine why you should always use them

47
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:15,000
and never use infrastructure ever again.
