1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:02,006
- Before we talk about the code part

2
00:00:02,006 --> 00:00:04,003
of infrastructure as code,

3
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:05,009
we want to start out with this chapter

4
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:07,009
talking about modern infrastructure

5
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:10,009
and how it lends itself to automation.

6
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:12,004
In this video, we're going to talk about

7
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:16,003
one of my favorite subjects, cloud computing.

8
00:00:16,003 --> 00:00:18,001
If you're familiar with using the cloud,

9
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:20,006
this may just be a refresher for you,

10
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:22,005
but we wanted to do some explanation

11
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:24,009
for folks that haven't gotten to work with the cloud yet

12
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:27,002
and may have only heard about it.

13
00:00:27,002 --> 00:00:29,001
So what is the cloud,

14
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:32,001
besides the place your photos go to die?

15
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:34,002
While arguing about what is cloud

16
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:36,002
was popular for a few years,

17
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:37,007
most agree that the definition

18
00:00:37,007 --> 00:00:40,005
that the US National Institute of Standards and Technology

19
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:44,007
put out in 2011 is sufficiently definitive.

20
00:00:44,007 --> 00:00:47,004
Cloud is characterized by on demand,

21
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:51,004
self-service provisioning, broad network access,

22
00:00:51,004 --> 00:00:56,006
resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service.

23
00:00:56,006 --> 00:01:00,000
And there are three general cloud service models.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,004
Software as a service, or SaaS,

25
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:05,003
is where an entire application is provided for you

26
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:07,000
live from the internet.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,003
Salesforce, TurboTax, and Office 365 are examples of SaaS.

28
00:01:12,003 --> 00:01:14,007
Platform as a service, or PaaS,

29
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,009
is where you can deploy custom applications

30
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:19,006
to the cloud platform without managing

31
00:01:19,006 --> 00:01:22,002
the underlying systems yourself.

32
00:01:22,002 --> 00:01:25,002
Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service,

33
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:29,008
and Pivotal Web Services or examples of public PaaSes.

34
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:31,004
Infrastructure as a service,

35
00:01:31,004 --> 00:01:34,003
pronounced I-A-A-S for obvious reasons,

36
00:01:34,003 --> 00:01:37,000
is where you get operating system level access

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,003
to discrete systems in the cloud.

38
00:01:39,003 --> 00:01:42,004
These are usually VMs and not bare metal.

39
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:45,008
Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines,

40
00:01:45,008 --> 00:01:51,008
and Amazon Web Services EC2 showcase IaaS offerings.

41
00:01:51,008 --> 00:01:53,007
Of course, in the last decade plus

42
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:55,009
cloud offerings have gotten more sophisticated

43
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:58,001
and are part of practically everything.

44
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:01,004
Your Nest home thermostat, cell phone, Alexa,

45
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:04,005
and so on all use cloud services.

46
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:07,005
But this mysterious force that rules your life

47
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:11,002
is really just servers in real world data centers.

48
00:02:11,002 --> 00:02:14,004
Cloud providers like Amazon Web Services

49
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:19,003
make servers, storage, and more available to use at a click.

50
00:02:19,003 --> 00:02:23,000
You can go sign up for an AWS account using their free tier

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,006
or with a credit card,

52
00:02:24,006 --> 00:02:27,003
go into their EC2 Elastic Compute service,

53
00:02:27,003 --> 00:02:29,006
click to choose the size of the server you want,

54
00:02:29,006 --> 00:02:31,004
what operating system you want.

55
00:02:31,004 --> 00:02:32,005
In about five minutes,

56
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:34,003
you can have a Windows or Linux server

57
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:37,008
of just about any size with as much storage as you want,

58
00:02:37,008 --> 00:02:41,005
even with GPUs and other high performance add-ons.

59
00:02:41,005 --> 00:02:43,005
You can open it up to the whole internet

60
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:45,000
to host a web server on,

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,006
or keep it locked down for just your use.

62
00:02:47,006 --> 00:02:49,004
But you can reach it from anywhere in the world

63
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:51,006
that you can jack into cyberspace,

64
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:53,008
as the kids say nowadays,

65
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:55,002
The cloud providers can do this,

66
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:56,005
because they have big data centers

67
00:02:56,005 --> 00:02:58,008
full of servers and storage around the world

68
00:02:58,008 --> 00:03:00,006
and they're just assigning one of them to you

69
00:03:00,006 --> 00:03:02,002
when you ask for it.

70
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:03,009
That's a big difference from the old days

71
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:06,004
of fighting with a system admin team for six weeks

72
00:03:06,004 --> 00:03:10,002
to get three more servers into the data center.

73
00:03:10,002 --> 00:03:12,002
Anyway, this means if you need two

74
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:15,000
or a hundred servers instead of just one,

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,008
you can easily ask for that many

76
00:03:16,008 --> 00:03:19,003
and scale right up in minutes.

77
00:03:19,003 --> 00:03:21,000
Amazon can rent that capacity out

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
to somebody else when you're not using it,

79
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,008
so they just charge you by the minute.

80
00:03:24,008 --> 00:03:26,001
Like we used to pay per minute

81
00:03:26,001 --> 00:03:28,006
for long distance phone calls.

82
00:03:28,006 --> 00:03:31,005
If you need to just use a computer for four hours,

83
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:32,008
you pay for four hours.

84
00:03:32,008 --> 00:03:34,006
You're not buying a physical server

85
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,009
that you have to pay full price for upfront

86
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:39,007
and then keep around whether you're using it or not

87
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:41,007
or whether it breaks or not.

88
00:03:41,007 --> 00:03:43,006
And that's the cloud in a nutshell.

89
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:45,001
Instead of buying your own hardware,

90
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:47,006
waiting for it to get put into a data center and loaded up,

91
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:49,009
and then depreciating it over time

92
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:51,005
while you get sadder and sadder

93
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:53,006
about its performance every year,

94
00:03:53,006 --> 00:03:55,005
you could just reach out, grab a resource

95
00:03:55,005 --> 00:03:57,008
of the size you want, get it right now,

96
00:03:57,008 --> 00:04:00,004
just pay for it while you use it.

97
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:03,001
And maybe most importantly, to use the cloud,

98
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:06,004
sure, you can use their UI or command line tools,

99
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:09,004
but all the clouds have a fully featured API

100
00:04:09,004 --> 00:04:13,004
that you can integrate with your own tools or code.

101
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:14,004
In our next video,

102
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,004
we'll talk about when you might use the cloud

103
00:04:16,004 --> 00:04:19,000
and when you might want to use your own data center.
