1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:03,005
- Okay, so now we're actually at the end of the course

2
00:00:03,005 --> 00:00:05,001
but how do you get started?

3
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:07,007
- There are plenty of tool courses here in the library

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,007
but what do you do first?

5
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:12,009
When I first got into DevOps and infrastructures code

6
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:15,003
I came from more of a CIS admin background.

7
00:00:15,003 --> 00:00:16,003
- Me too.

8
00:00:16,003 --> 00:00:18,006
- Yeah, and one thing I did that really helped me

9
00:00:18,006 --> 00:00:20,001
was to learn Ruby.

10
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:23,000
Chef, Puppet, Serverspec and Cucumber.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,002
They're all written in Ruby.

12
00:00:24,002 --> 00:00:25,005
And learning a new language

13
00:00:25,005 --> 00:00:27,009
helped me to get up to speed faster.

14
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:30,000
- Maybe you come from a dev background

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,005
in which case you already understand the approach

16
00:00:32,005 --> 00:00:34,005
but if you come from an operations background

17
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:37,003
you might consider taking some coding courses.

18
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,001
It doesn't matter what language

19
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:42,003
but Python can be helpful in the DevOps world.

20
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:44,007
Really just learning the process of development

21
00:00:44,007 --> 00:00:45,009
will help you understand

22
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:48,004
how to perform infrastructure automation.

23
00:00:48,004 --> 00:00:50,003
It's not just using the tools

24
00:00:50,003 --> 00:00:53,003
it's following a development process.

25
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:55,005
- The culture change required to get yourself

26
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:59,000
and your colleagues to embrace this process is key.

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,007
Making changes through automation

28
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:03,005
and writing tests first for any infrastructure code

29
00:01:03,005 --> 00:01:06,005
are basic techniques that you have to do all the time

30
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:09,001
every time to be successful.

31
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:11,003
- The other culture challenge is finding ways

32
00:01:11,003 --> 00:01:14,007
to collaborate more tightly between the devs and ops.

33
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:17,004
Resist the urge towards local optimization

34
00:01:17,004 --> 00:01:19,008
and choosing tools or processes

35
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:22,004
that are best just for you or your team

36
00:01:22,004 --> 00:01:25,002
instead of what's best for the overall chain of teams

37
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:28,006
that have to work together to deliver the end product.

38
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:30,003
- But let's say you're willing to start.

39
00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:33,007
How do you introduce this into an existing environment?

40
00:01:33,007 --> 00:01:36,002
- One way to introduce new tools and techniques

41
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:38,006
is to choose an upcoming new project

42
00:01:38,006 --> 00:01:41,002
and develop that project in the new way.

43
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:43,008
This is called a Greenfield Project.

44
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:46,000
- You know, our first pure implementation

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,007
of infrastructure automation

46
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:50,001
was in a Greenfield Project like this.

47
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:51,002
It's easier to get it done

48
00:01:51,002 --> 00:01:53,003
when there's fewer legacy dependencies,

49
00:01:53,003 --> 00:01:55,005
and then you can show the benefits to everyone else

50
00:01:55,005 --> 00:01:57,001
in a real project.

51
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:58,005
- But sometimes you're stuck

52
00:01:58,005 --> 00:02:00,005
with needing to change a legacy system.

53
00:02:00,005 --> 00:02:04,001
What's charmingly referred to as Brownfield Development.

54
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:05,009
- And that brown isn't dirt.

55
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:07,008
- So true.

56
00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:10,005
In this situation, look for a single process

57
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:12,004
to start with and automate it.

58
00:02:12,004 --> 00:02:14,008
Ideally something that's a major pain point.

59
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,004
- When Ernest and I first worked together,

60
00:02:16,004 --> 00:02:18,008
we inherited a large legacy web system

61
00:02:18,008 --> 00:02:20,004
that had no automation.

62
00:02:20,004 --> 00:02:21,007
We had to find a place to start.

63
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:24,007
So we identified the one piece to start with.

64
00:02:24,007 --> 00:02:27,002
- We selected our Java application deployments

65
00:02:27,002 --> 00:02:29,005
like I mentioned in an earlier video.

66
00:02:29,005 --> 00:02:31,003
We chose a tool to use,

67
00:02:31,003 --> 00:02:33,000
in this case was just a Perl script.

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,004
It was a long time ago.

69
00:02:34,004 --> 00:02:37,008
So all these fancy tools didn't exist yet.

70
00:02:37,008 --> 00:02:40,007
We defined the state we wanted to create using code,

71
00:02:40,007 --> 00:02:43,005
tested it, and set up production monitoring

72
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:45,007
and unleashed it on the developers.

73
00:02:45,007 --> 00:02:47,001
- We now know that was right

74
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:49,009
because that's what ChatGPT says to do.

75
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:51,003
- True story, bro.

76
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:53,000
- And then we used what was called

77
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,002
the strangler pattern to proceed.

78
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:57,003
We implemented a new piece of automation

79
00:02:57,003 --> 00:03:00,003
for a piece of our stack, deprecate the old process,

80
00:03:00,003 --> 00:03:02,009
and then eventually the new automated infrastructure

81
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:06,000
would strangle out all the old manual stuff.

82
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,002
- That worked well, but it wasn't as successful

83
00:03:08,002 --> 00:03:10,008
as our second implementation when we realized

84
00:03:10,008 --> 00:03:13,001
how important both test first

85
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:15,007
and integrating our infrastructure automation

86
00:03:15,007 --> 00:03:18,006
with our continuous deployment pipeline was.

87
00:03:18,006 --> 00:03:20,007
- Yeah, there's no single answer,

88
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:22,004
but we hope that this will give you some ideas

89
00:03:22,004 --> 00:03:23,009
on how you can begin to incorporate

90
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:26,008
infrastructure automation into your own systems.

91
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:28,004
- We wish you the best of luck

92
00:03:28,004 --> 00:03:30,006
in automating your own infrastructure.

93
00:03:30,006 --> 00:03:32,009
We know that the benefits you'll see will change

94
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:34,006
how you work for the better.

95
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,000
Thanks for joining us.
