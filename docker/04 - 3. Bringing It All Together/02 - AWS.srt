00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:02,007
- [Instructor] Welcome to "The Provisioning Lab."

2
00:00:02,007 --> 00:00:05,003
If you already know how to use Amazon Web Services,

3
00:00:05,003 --> 00:00:07,002
you can skip to the next video,

4
00:00:07,002 --> 00:00:09,006
but I wanted to make sure that everyone's following along

5
00:00:09,006 --> 00:00:11,009
when we make our infrastructure in Terraform

6
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:14,006
and go into AWS to inspect it.

7
00:00:14,006 --> 00:00:17,004
Here, we're at the Amazon Web Services homepage,

8
00:00:17,004 --> 00:00:20,003
aws.amazon.com.

9
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:23,002
If you haven't created an AWS account yet,

10
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:25,007
this orange button in the top right will offer you

11
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:28,008
a "Create a new AWS account" option.

12
00:00:28,008 --> 00:00:30,006
In my case, my Alexa's been listening

13
00:00:30,006 --> 00:00:33,003
to my every word and knows that I already have one,

14
00:00:33,003 --> 00:00:36,002
so it just tells me to log onto the console.

15
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:39,007
That's just a little joke, Alexa. Please don't hurt me.

16
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:42,002
So now, we're in the AWS console.

17
00:00:42,002 --> 00:00:44,006
Most things you can do in here you can also do

18
00:00:44,006 --> 00:00:48,006
via the AWS Command Line Interface tool or the API,

19
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,009
but it's easier to illustrate visually here,

20
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:54,005
so we'll leave the CLI and API for later.

21
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:57,009
Remember, this lab isn't a full walkthrough of AWS,

22
00:00:57,009 --> 00:00:59,003
but if you've just signed up

23
00:00:59,003 --> 00:01:04,001
for an AWS account and you're logged in as the root account,

24
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:07,009
you're going to want to go into Security Credentials,

25
00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:12,002
set up multifactor authentication on that account,

26
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:15,001
create a new IAM admin account,

27
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:16,008
I've made one called "emueller"

28
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:19,003
that I've given administrative rights,

29
00:01:19,003 --> 00:01:21,008
and then log out as the root account,

30
00:01:21,008 --> 00:01:25,006
log in as your new IM admin account,

31
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:28,004
set up multifactor authentication on that,

32
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,003
and then you can set

33
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:31,000
up the access keys that you're going to use

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,008
to programmatically access your account

35
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:35,006
over the course of the lab,

36
00:01:35,006 --> 00:01:36,009
but using the root account

37
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:39,007
is the number one security risk in AWS.

38
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:41,001
You're going to want to lock that one away

39
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,009
in a box for a rainy day.

40
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:45,002
The number two security risk is not

41
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:47,009
having multifactor authentication set up on your accounts.

42
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,007
So, make sure and do those two things before we get started.

43
00:01:51,007 --> 00:01:55,007
Here's the massive list of services available in AWS.

44
00:01:55,007 --> 00:02:00,007
Everything from compute and storage and online databases,

45
00:02:00,007 --> 00:02:04,008
to fancier things like machine learning services,

46
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:08,007
game development, all sorts of things,

47
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:13,000
but what we're going to go look at is under Compute.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,005
EC2, which stands for Elastic Compute Cloud,

49
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:20,006
this is where you go to run virtual servers in the cloud.

50
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,007
So, there's only so easy

51
00:02:22,007 --> 00:02:25,009
that Amazon can make running a server,

52
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:28,007
so you'll see here in the sidebar all sorts

53
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:33,003
of options for manipulating images, storage, networking,

54
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:35,003
security, and so on,

55
00:02:35,003 --> 00:02:38,000
but you can get started with just saying defaults.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,002
So, I'm going to show you how easy it is to start

57
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:43,003
a virtual server in the cloud.

58
00:02:43,003 --> 00:02:46,009
First, go to this pop down in the top right

59
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:49,007
and pick a geographic region that you want

60
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:50,009
to run your server in

61
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:53,008
and switch to that region in the console.

62
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:56,008
I'm going to choose Oregon because I hear

63
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:58,001
that the data centers there

64
00:02:58,001 --> 00:03:00,001
are outstanding in their field.

65
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:02,007
(Instructor snickering)

66
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:05,001
Okay, back to the console.

67
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:08,002
So, the Instances section is where you see

68
00:03:08,002 --> 00:03:10,004
any servers that you have running.

69
00:03:10,004 --> 00:03:12,001
We don't have any right now.

70
00:03:12,001 --> 00:03:15,007
So, I'm going to go up to "Launch Instances,"

71
00:03:15,007 --> 00:03:19,006
which is going to open up our little wizard

72
00:03:19,006 --> 00:03:22,008
that they have for you to run a new server.

73
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:24,005
First thing, we're going to name it.

74
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:27,001
I'll just call it "Test Server."

75
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:29,007
Next, you pick an image to start it from.

76
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:33,008
There are all of the common operating systems represented,

77
00:03:33,008 --> 00:03:36,009
thousands of community-contributed images,

78
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:39,001
and you can even create your own.

79
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:42,006
I'm going to pick Ubuntu 22.04.

80
00:03:42,006 --> 00:03:44,004
Then, you pick an instance type.

81
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:46,008
This is essentially the hardware size

82
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:49,004
of the virtual server you're going to make.

83
00:03:49,004 --> 00:03:54,006
This can be anything from a tiny micro instance on

84
00:03:54,006 --> 00:03:56,007
through a bunch of larger options

85
00:03:56,007 --> 00:04:02,004
and then all the way down to giant, bare-metal instances

86
00:04:02,004 --> 00:04:06,009
with 48 CPUs and 384 gigs of memory.

87
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:08,006
This is running on my credit card,

88
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:11,001
so we're going to go for the small one.

89
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,008
So next, I'm going to pick an SSH key pair

90
00:04:13,008 --> 00:04:16,001
to use to connect to the instance.

91
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:17,004
Now, I'm cheating a little bit

92
00:04:17,004 --> 00:04:21,007
because you have to create this locally and then import it,

93
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:25,002
but instructions for that are in the lab materials.

94
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:29,000
Then, you set up any other options like network security.

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,008
I'm going to let us SSH

96
00:04:30,008 --> 00:04:34,004
in from anywhere to make it easy to connect,

97
00:04:34,004 --> 00:04:36,005
and then you have a bunch of other options,

98
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:39,000
how much storage, advanced details,

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,007
but I'm just going to take the defaults,

100
00:04:40,007 --> 00:04:46,004
and then we go over here and we say "Launch Instance,"

101
00:04:46,004 --> 00:04:50,009
and it says it has started to launch it.

102
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:53,005
You can see it's impending state.

103
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:54,008
When you click on it,

104
00:04:54,008 --> 00:04:58,004
you can go in and see all sorts of other details,

105
00:04:58,004 --> 00:05:00,006
especially the public IP address

106
00:05:00,006 --> 00:05:03,000
that it's going to be available at.

107
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,008
Go check.

108
00:05:03,008 --> 00:05:08,002
Sure enough, it made an eight-gigabyte disc for the storage.

109
00:05:08,002 --> 00:05:10,009
You can look at your other security

110
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:14,001
and networking settings, and look,

111
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:16,005
it's already in running state.

112
00:05:16,005 --> 00:05:20,008
That is super quick, and to prove it, let's connect to it.

113
00:05:20,008 --> 00:05:23,005
I'm going to connect to it from the console.

114
00:05:23,005 --> 00:05:30,003
We could do it via SSH, but this is quick and easy.

115
00:05:30,003 --> 00:05:31,009
So, we'll connect in.

116
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:34,006
It's going to load up a virtual terminal here

117
00:05:34,006 --> 00:05:37,002
in the web browser,

118
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:38,003
and here we are.

119
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:41,003
We are at the command line

120
00:05:41,003 --> 00:05:45,001
of our very own brand new Ubuntu server.

121
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:46,005
That's faster than it'd take you to look

122
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:49,001
up Dell's phone number to order one.

123
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:51,000
Alright, so are you done with it?

124
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,006
Well, that's easy enough.

125
00:05:52,006 --> 00:05:56,005
We'll go back here to the EC2 console,

126
00:05:56,005 --> 00:06:00,003
and you can stop

127
00:06:00,003 --> 00:06:01,006
and start the instance,

128
00:06:01,006 --> 00:06:06,004
which is like powering it down and booting it back up again.

129
00:06:06,004 --> 00:06:07,009
While it's powered down,

130
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:09,008
it's not incurring the charges

131
00:06:09,008 --> 00:06:12,001
for the actual virtual server,

132
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:13,005
although there are still some charges

133
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:15,006
for keeping the disc alive,

134
00:06:15,006 --> 00:06:20,003
but we're going to terminate it, completely destroy it.

135
00:06:20,003 --> 00:06:22,002
So, it's going to warn us and say, hey,

136
00:06:22,002 --> 00:06:25,009
whatever you have on that disc drive is going to go away,

137
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:29,004
and we say, that's fine.

138
00:06:29,004 --> 00:06:32,006
It goes into shutting down mode,

139
00:06:32,006 --> 00:06:35,000
and then, in less than a minute,

140
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,006
it will go in to terminate it and it'll be gone.

141
00:06:37,006 --> 00:06:38,008
So, that's the cloud,

142
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:41,004
and that's how quickly you can get compute resources,

143
00:06:41,004 --> 00:06:44,008
just as much as you need for just as long as you need it,

144
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:46,006
which is perfect for automation.

145
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:48,009
So next video, we're going to build some infrastructure

146
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:51,000
at scale with Terraform.
