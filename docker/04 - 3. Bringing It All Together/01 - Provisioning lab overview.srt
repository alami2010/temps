00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:01,008
- In this chapter,

2
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:03,006
we're going to walk through a lab environment

3
00:00:03,006 --> 00:00:06,007
built with a variety of infrastructure automation tools,

4
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:10,007
working together to create a complete working environment.

5
00:00:10,007 --> 00:00:12,009
This lab is not an end-to-end walkthrough

6
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:15,006
of how to install and configure each of these tools

7
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:18,009
and how to write Terraform code, Ansible playbooks,

8
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:19,009
and so on.

9
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:22,002
There are entire courses here in the library

10
00:00:22,002 --> 00:00:23,007
that'll walk you through setting up

11
00:00:23,007 --> 00:00:25,007
and learning these tools.

12
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:28,000
Instead, our goal is to illustrate the concepts

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
we've talked about in the previous chapters

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,001
and let you see what infrastructure as code looks like

15
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:35,006
and how it works in practice.

16
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:36,008
Now, having said that,

17
00:00:36,008 --> 00:00:38,007
if you want to try to follow along,

18
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:39,008
we have a detailed guide

19
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:42,003
on exactly how we set up our lab environment

20
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:45,000
included in the class materials.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,007
You'll need a Mac or Linux desktop system

22
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:50,007
or a Windows system running Windows subsystem for Linux,

23
00:00:50,007 --> 00:00:53,000
or WSL2, installed.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,007
But all you really need to do from your local system

25
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:57,007
is generate an SSH key

26
00:00:57,007 --> 00:01:01,004
and SSH into a cloud server you create.

27
00:01:01,004 --> 00:01:04,000
You'll also need an Amazon Web Services account

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,004
with a credit card attached

29
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:06,006
as we'll be spinning up

30
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:09,009
a couple dollars an hour worth of infrastructure.

31
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:12,008
We're going to use an open source project called kubespray

32
00:01:12,008 --> 00:01:14,003
available on GitHub

33
00:01:14,003 --> 00:01:18,003
to create an AWS cloud infrastructure using Terraform.

34
00:01:18,003 --> 00:01:21,006
Then we'll install Kubernetes on it using Ansible,

35
00:01:21,006 --> 00:01:25,000
getting it ready for us to install our own application.

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,008
I'll walk through the infrastructure setup

37
00:01:26,008 --> 00:01:27,009
and then James will walk through

38
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:30,006
the application deployment options.

39
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:33,004
And we're not just making a play infrastructure.

40
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:35,006
We'll be creating a redundant infrastructure

41
00:01:35,006 --> 00:01:38,005
with appropriate network security in the cloud.

42
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:40,005
We'll take it step by step, though.

43
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:43,004
We'll do a separate video covering each layer.

44
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:45,009
Remember, the goal here isn't to become an expert

45
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:47,008
in AWS or Ansible.

46
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:50,001
It's to understand the ways you can automate

47
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:52,000
each layer of system set up

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,009
and prepare to take proper advantage

49
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,002
of infrastructure as code.

50
00:01:56,002 --> 00:01:58,007
I'll see you back here to introduce you to the cloud,

51
00:01:58,007 --> 00:02:01,000
in this case, Amazon Web Services.
