1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:02,001
- Managed services are great

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:03,009
because we don't have to do all the care

3
00:00:03,009 --> 00:00:05,004
and feeding of infrastructure

4
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:07,008
and can focus on delivering value.

5
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:10,007
- Okay now you're starting to sound like a commercial.

6
00:00:10,007 --> 00:00:12,007
Do you work for Amazon now?

7
00:00:12,007 --> 00:00:16,009
- [Narrator] Managed services versus Bare Cloud fight.

8
00:00:16,009 --> 00:00:19,001
- But managed services get you so much more

9
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:20,008
than basic services do,

10
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:21,009
you know, for example

11
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:24,003
let's say you want to try out a new database.

12
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:26,001
Previously you would've hired consultants

13
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:28,008
to get it up and running or found expert staff

14
00:00:28,008 --> 00:00:31,005
but neither of them are cheap.

15
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:34,004
- Yeah but is that database really fully managed?

16
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:36,002
You still need database expertise

17
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:38,001
for your schema and your tuning,

18
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:40,008
even though you may not have to manage the servers

19
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:44,000
the database is still largely up to you to configure.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,006
- Okay yeah, you still have some things to do

21
00:00:46,006 --> 00:00:48,004
but not nearly as many.

22
00:00:48,004 --> 00:00:50,007
Instead, you can now make a few API calls

23
00:00:50,007 --> 00:00:52,009
and have a full database ready to go

24
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:55,004
managed by your provider and ready to scale instead

25
00:00:55,004 --> 00:00:56,006
of waiting for a month or two

26
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:59,006
for your DBAs to get around to doing something.

27
00:00:59,006 --> 00:01:03,003
- But that abstraction layer is preventing you from tuning

28
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:06,000
and doing like the deep down details you need to do

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,001
for super demanding workloads, isn't it?

30
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,001
- Okay, sure,

31
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:11,001
if you're one of the FAANG companies,

32
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:14,008
you can worry about that, but 90% of the companies out there

33
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:17,006
they don't really need that level of customization

34
00:01:17,006 --> 00:01:18,009
and no one really needs it

35
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:21,008
for the majority of their services, just the key ones.

36
00:01:21,008 --> 00:01:23,005
Okay so in the case of Kubernetes

37
00:01:23,005 --> 00:01:25,005
would you rather run your own cluster

38
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:27,007
and manage it and all the ins and outs of Kubernetes

39
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:30,005
or would you rather use EKS from Amazon

40
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:31,005
and get all the benefits

41
00:01:31,005 --> 00:01:34,009
without having to hire all the new staff Ernest?

42
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:36,003
- It's great if you want to use

43
00:01:36,003 --> 00:01:38,004
what the man wants you to use,

44
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:40,004
what if they don't have the version

45
00:01:40,004 --> 00:01:42,008
or functionality or whatever you need?

46
00:01:42,008 --> 00:01:45,002
For example, the managed Kubernetes services

47
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:47,006
are always lagging behind the newest releases

48
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:50,009
and so you miss out on a lot of the cutting edge features

49
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,005
and you can't customize as much

50
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:54,007
as you can when you're running it directly.

51
00:01:54,007 --> 00:01:58,002
- Okay yeah, sure, yeah you may be a bit behind

52
00:01:58,002 --> 00:02:00,007
the bleeding edge of a particular technology,

53
00:02:00,007 --> 00:02:03,009
but that may be seen as a positive in many organizations,

54
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:06,000
for small teams or the scrappy startup

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,007
looking to build out services

56
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:11,006
the friction and cost has really been significantly reduced.

57
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,007
- But from the startup point of view

58
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:15,001
they're also more expensive.

59
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,006
You pay for all that management

60
00:02:16,006 --> 00:02:18,003
they put on top of it.

61
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:20,004
In one shop I used MongoDB Atlas,

62
00:02:20,004 --> 00:02:22,000
their managed database service,

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,006
and it was cool that I could upgrade versions

64
00:02:24,006 --> 00:02:27,000
or server sizes with the click of a button,

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,003
but then they charged me out the nose for backups.

66
00:02:30,003 --> 00:02:31,009
- Okay, definitely,

67
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:33,009
but what could your engineering effort

68
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:36,008
that you save do to accelerate the actual startup,

69
00:02:36,008 --> 00:02:38,006
you know and the success of it,

70
00:02:38,006 --> 00:02:39,008
and it's often worth money

71
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:42,003
to get back all that engineering time.

72
00:02:42,003 --> 00:02:44,009
Managed services aren't just for startups either.

73
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:47,000
Many of the companies that we've both worked at

74
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,001
in the last decade, including mid-size enterprises

75
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:51,003
have migrated completely

76
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:53,007
to public cloud hosting for their computing needs,

77
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,002
and this includes using more

78
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:57,008
than just compute and network and storage.

79
00:02:57,008 --> 00:02:59,001
- Well, but that brings up

80
00:02:59,001 --> 00:03:01,005
another challenge with managed services.

81
00:03:01,005 --> 00:03:05,000
They're not portable across clouds or to your data center.

82
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,009
If you're using one cloud service

83
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:10,002
it's often not compatible at all with another's.

84
00:03:10,002 --> 00:03:14,004
- Okay well but isn't that great from a buyer's perspective?

85
00:03:14,004 --> 00:03:17,005
You know, competition between all the major cloud providers

86
00:03:17,005 --> 00:03:19,003
and all the options we get to use,

87
00:03:19,003 --> 00:03:23,000
we never thought we would've had those in the pre-cloud era.

88
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,009
- I mean, it is, except for the harm it often does

89
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:28,000
to those open source ecosystems.

90
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The cloud providers have sometimes been fairly predatory

91
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
in taking open source products

92
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and forking and monetizing them

93
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,004
to the detriment of those communities health.

94
00:03:37,004 --> 00:03:39,007
- Okay all right, out of everything you've said,

95
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:41,000
you do have a point there,

96
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,007
but as for the rest of your points about customizability

97
00:03:43,007 --> 00:03:46,002
and multi-cloud what percentage of the shops

98
00:03:46,002 --> 00:03:48,007
that you've worked at in the last 20 years,

99
00:03:48,007 --> 00:03:51,001
where they've really needed any of that,

100
00:03:51,001 --> 00:03:54,001
instead of just moving more quickly to market?

101
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:57,004
- Well maybe 10%.

102
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:59,004
- Okay I rest my case.

103
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:00,000
(banging)
