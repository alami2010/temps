1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:03,005
- If you work in tech, you've probably either spent hours

2
00:00:03,005 --> 00:00:05,000
building systems by hand

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,007
- Or waited weeks for someone else

4
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:08,002
to build those systems for you.

5
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:09,009
- Slow and unreliable.

6
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,000
What could be better?

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,008
- Well, today's systems demand a modern solution.

8
00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:15,002
What you need is

9
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:17,004
- [Together] infrastructure as code.

10
00:00:17,004 --> 00:00:19,000
- Howdy, I'm Ernest Mueller.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,004
- And I'm James Wickett.

12
00:00:20,004 --> 00:00:22,004
- We first met while implementing DevOps

13
00:00:22,004 --> 00:00:23,005
at a large enterprise.

14
00:00:23,005 --> 00:00:25,004
- And we've been friends ever since.

15
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:27,006
We both feel that infrastructure as code

16
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:30,000
is one of the fundamental practice areas of DevOps

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,001
and one of the most revolutionary.

18
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:34,005
- With IAC, as the kids call it,

19
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:36,007
you can generate high quality systems

20
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:40,001
that you can reliably test, consistently reproduce,

21
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:42,002
and change quickly and safely.

22
00:00:42,002 --> 00:00:44,003
- Our course will teach you all the tools,

23
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:46,004
tips and techniques that we've learned over the years

24
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,003
to get infrastructure as code right.

25
00:00:48,003 --> 00:00:49,000
- So let's start automating.
